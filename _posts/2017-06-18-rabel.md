    </div>
  

### 1.2 Quickstart Installation




## 2. Theme Configuration

Most theme configuration can be found at <Magento Backend>->CATTHEME->Rabel Theme Config

![Rabel Theme Configuration](../../images/rabel_theme_configuration.jpg)

All configurations are listed by several sections:

![Configuration Listing](../../images/configurations_listing.jpg)

There are many options in these sections, you can input color value, select header type or input header height etc to the options, before we start to discuss all options, please remember,
after you complete options selection, don't forget to click "Save Config" button to store your selections to database.

![Save Config](../../images/save_config.jpg)

Now we will discuss details of all there configurations.

## 3. Font

Font options will show when you select Custom Option to "Yes"
In this sections, we divide all font configurations to 6 groups, they are body font, Element Font 1 to Element Font 5  

### 3.1 Body Font

![Theme Font Customization](../../images/theme_font_customization.jpg)

Body font is global setting for entire website.

Body Font Size: select body font size.

Body Font Weight: input body font weight.

Body Font Style: select body font style.

Body Font Family: you can select system general fonts, or google font, when you select google font option, a new option "Body Font Family - Google Fonts" will appear.

Body Font Family - Google Fonts: you can select google font, after you select a google font, the font preview will be showed.

See below picture for a example:

![Body Font Customization](../../images/body_font_custom.jpg)

Select "Eagle Lake" google font for body and then click "Save Config" button in backend top right corner, now refresh your store frontend and you can find the site font was changed according your selecation.

![Body Font Effect](../../images/body_font_effect.jpg)

### 3.2 Element Font 1 - Element Font 5

With Element Font, we can customize font for specific html element, For example, we want change font family for product name of category and product page, 
First, we need to find css class or ID of product name by using  browser development tools(Firefox or Chrome).
 
In Firefox, we find class for product name of 
category page is '.prodduct-item-link' (don't forget add "." for css class and "#" for id).

![Product Name class for category page](../../images/product_name_css_element.jpg)

And class for product name of product page is '.product-content-wrapper .page-title'.

![Product Name class for product page](../../images/product_name_css_class.jpg)

So we have Font Element 1 options like below picture: 

![Element Font Setting](../../images/element_font.jpg)

we only change font-family and leave element font size, weight and style to theirs default value, 
So in website frontend, product name style will inherit font size, weight and style setting from theme and only font family is changed to
 "petit Formal Script". 
 
![Product Name in Category Page](../../images/product_name_font_in_category.jpg)
![Product Name in Product Page](../../images/product_name_font.jpg)

We have 5 Element Font options group, so you can different html element to different font family, size weight and style.

## 4. Color

In this section, we have "predefined Color Scheme" options, you can select different color scheme, if you are not satisfied with default or predefined 
color, you can select "custom" options to "yes", and input your color for different area of the website.

![Color Setting](../../images/color_setting.jpg)

After set "custom" option to "yes", all color input options will be appear, color options are divided into groups (General, Header, Megamenu 
Category Page, Newsletter Popup, Before Footer, Footer).  

In order to color for a option, just click text input field, a color picker will be
showed, now select the color from picker, of course, if you already have hex color code, just input the code directly to the text input field.

![Color Picker](../../images/color_picker.jpg)

After you complete all you color options, don't forget to click "Save Config" button to save your choice.

## 5. General
